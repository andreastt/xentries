XENTRIES

  xentries is a program that extracts and serialises useful metadata
  from HTML documents, such as entries to a weblog.
  
  It produces an XML serialisation of the found entries that can
  later be used as input for syndication feed post-processing, e.g.
  through xsltproc.

INPUT

  The program extracts a document's full file path, title, creation-
  and modification times, tags, and the full content summary.

  Creation- and modification times (ctime and mtime, respectively)
  are fetched from git.  It is assumed that all input documents
  live under git revision control.

  Tags are looked for in <meta name=keywords content=foo,bar>
  elements, where multiple tags can be specified using commas.

  The content summary is basically the rest of the document except
  <h1>, <address>, and <footer> elements.

USAGE

  The program accepts the following flags and arguments:
  
   	[-v] [-t TAG] DOCUMENT [, DOCUMENT]

  The optional -v flag makes the output more verbose.

  The optional -t TAG flag will filter the input documents and only
  make entries of those marked with the given tag.

  After this you must provide at least one DOCUMENT for the program
  to act on.

  Typical usage:

  	% xentries -t weblog 2011/first 2012/second | xsltproc feed.xsl - >weblog.atom
  	
  This is still work in progress, but it's fully functional.

BUGS

  This is not an example of a good program.  It fills a highly
  specific personal use case.
  
  A better implementation would accept user-defined blocklists,
  arbitrary templates for what information to extract from the
  document, and custom output formats.
